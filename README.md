ML Regression and Classification Algorithms

In this repository, I have worked on and added 5 Machine Learning Projects.
I have downloaded the data set from Kaggle and other resources.

Projects:
1)Credit card fraud detection:
-->Built classification model using Logistic regression.

2)Car price prediction:
-->Used Linear regression algorithm to build a regression model.

3)Real Estate House Price Prediction:
-->Used Linear Regression, SVR, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Algorithms to build a classification model.
-->Used GridSearchCV to Hypertune the parameters.

4)Salary Prediction (If it is <=50K or >50K):
-->Model built using Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Decision Tree.
-->Hypertuned parameters using GridSearchCV

5)Advertisement:
-->Using Logistic Regression
